# Flower Bed Designer

Flower Bed Designer is an app that recommends which flowers to plant and where to plant them in a given area (the flower
 bed), based on user-provided criteria and its own database of plants. 
 
That's the intent, anyway. Right now it's in early development and consists of a REST api proof-of-concept.

This app is inspired by my experience attempting to create a flower garden using native plants. Even though I know lots
about native species and their preferred growing conditions, I found it very difficult to combine them in a way that was
both practical and attractive in a backyard setting.
